# Project Proposal

## Description

My project will be a cooperative puzzle game for two players. Each player will control a character, either using WASD or the arrow keys. One character will be smaller than the other and be able to fit into smaller spaces and the other will be able to jump higher. There will be a few dangers on each level that the players will have to avoid. The goal for the players is to work together and collect a key to open a door that leads to the next level. 

## Need to Have List

- Two moving characters That obey the laws of physics
    - They should only be able to walk on the ground
    - Dangers should kill them and cause a 'level failed' screen
    - They should be able to jump
    - They should spawn in a proper place on each level
- At least two working levels with ground and dangers
- The ability to end a level and go to the next one

## Nice to Have List

- Moveable Object (Barrel?)
- An extra item that can be collected on each level
- Moving enemies
- In game buttons that can be pressed by characters
- A skip level function
- A few tutorial levels or a 'how to play' menu
